🛒 Retail Sales Analysis Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data to uncover key business insights. Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard that highlights sales performance, customer trends, product insights, and regional analysis.

The goal was to help retail businesses make data-driven decisions by understanding:

Which products generate the most sales

Who their top customers are

Regional sales performance

Profitability trends over time

🔧 Tools & Technologies

Power BI → Dashboard creation, data modeling, DAX measures

Excel → Data cleaning and preprocessing

Dataset → Sample retail sales dataset (transactions, customers, products, regions)

📊 Key Features

Overview Page → KPIs like Total Sales, Profit, Quantity, and Average Order Value (AOV).

Time Analysis → Monthly and yearly trends for sales and profit.

Customer Insights → New vs Repeat customers, Top 5 customers by revenue.

Product Insights → Top 5 & Bottom 5 selling products, Profit margin by category.

Regional Analysis → Sales and profit by city & customer type.

📈 Key Insights

💡 20% of customers contributed to ~60% of revenue.

📦 Top products included Envelopes, Mobiles, Bookcases, Pens, Printers.

🏙️ New Delhi, Hyderabad, and Warangal were the top-performing cities.

📉 Categories like Paper & Binders had the lowest sales.
